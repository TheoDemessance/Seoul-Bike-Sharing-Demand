# Seoul Bike Sharing Demand Prediction

Bike sharing systems are a means of renting bicycles where the process of obtaining membership, rental, and bike return is automated via a network of kiosk locations throughout a city. Using these systems, people are able rent a bike from a one location and return it to a different place on an as-needed basis. Currently, there are over 500 bike-sharing programs around the world.

The data generated by these systems makes them attractive for researchers because the duration of travel, departure location, arrival location, and time elapsed is explicitly recorded. Bike sharing systems therefore function as a sensor network, which can be used for studying mobility in a city. In this project, we are asked to combine historical usage patterns with weather data in order to forecast bike rental demand in the Bikeshare program in Seoul, South Korea.

This GitHub project is designed as follows:

1. In this folder, you'll have access to the csv file and the notebook where a Deep Exploratory Analysis has been performed. Besides, several basics Machine Learning algorithms has been trained and used to achieve a RMSE of 0.34

2. This folder presents you a Django API which has been created with a Random Forest. 

3. A PowerPoint in PDF format, which presents you the ins and outs of the problem and our thoughts on the question posed.
